💼 Smart Loan Recovery System  
A machine learning project focused on predicting loan repayment outcomes to support financial institutions in streamlining their recovery efforts. This solution applies classification algorithms to analyze borrower behavior and forecast the likelihood of loan defaults.

🔍 Project Overview  
Loan recovery is a crucial aspect of financial services, especially in minimizing non-performing assets. This project utilizes data analysis and machine learning techniques to assess borrower profiles and predict whether a loan will be repaid or defaulted, thereby helping institutions prioritize recovery actions effectively.

📊 Objectives:
- Analyze borrower and loan-related data for patterns linked to repayment behavior.
- Preprocess, clean, and visualize the dataset.
- Train and evaluate classification models for predicting loan recovery.
- Identify the most accurate and interpretable model for deployment.
